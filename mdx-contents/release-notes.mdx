# Taboo AI Release Notes

_v3.3.5 on 10 Apr 2025_

Hi hi awesome human! ðŸ‘‹ Taboo AI has come a long way since becoming free to use for everyone since 1 May 2024 - V3.2.0. As a solo developer, I'm thrilled to have been able to share this fun little EdTech game with English learners and teachers all around the world. However, running it, improving it, and keeping the AI magic alive does cost a few real-world beans (the monetary kind... and coffee ones too â˜•ðŸ˜…).

That's why I set up a [coffee](https://taboo-ai.com/coffee) page! If you've enjoyed using Taboo AI and want to help me keep it alive and thriving, consider donating a coffee or two! It fuels my brain, my code, and this cozy corner of the internet, allowing me to continue maintaining and improving Taboo AI to benefit more individuals and educators in English learning and teaching. ðŸ’»âœ¨
