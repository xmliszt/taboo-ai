Hey awesome human! ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m the solo dev behind Taboo AI â€” a fun little EdTech game helping English learners and teachers all around the world. The game is totally free to use (yay!) â€” but running it, improving it, and keeping the AI magic alive does cost me a few real-world beans (the monetary kind... and coffee ones too â˜•ðŸ˜…).

If youâ€™ve enjoyed using Taboo AI and want to help me keep it alive and thriving, consider donating a coffee or two! It fuels my brain, my code, and this cozy corner of the internet. ðŸ’»âœ¨
