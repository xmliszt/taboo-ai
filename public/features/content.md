If you go to the **Topics Page** ([Choose a topic](/levels)), you will find a new toggle switch on top that allows you to toggle between the normal level view, or our **new ranking view**. In ranking mode, each topic will showcase the **Best Score** and the **Top Scorer**. However, take note that only logged-in user's result can be ranked.
