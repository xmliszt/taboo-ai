# Local supabase

When you are running `npm run dev`, it is recommended that you run with a local supabase instance. For how to set up supabase for local dev, check out https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli/local-development.

Then ask me for the migration files, which you will need to populate the local postgres with existing schemas, roles and RLS policies.

# Contribute

To contribute, look at the [**Issues**](https://github.com/xmliszt/taboo-ai/issues) to find the one that you are interested in working with. Or raise your own issues. Once you are done, simply submit a pull request for review.

## Branching

Taboo AI has `main` branch for production, YOu can just branch out from `main` to work on your feature. Once you are done, submit a PR to `main` branch. This PR will automatically trigger **preview** pipeline to deploy a preview version. As a contributor, you should be invited into our Slack channel, from which the GitHub bot will notify you when the preview deployment is ready for review

## Local Dev Environment

When you clone the project, simply run `npm i && npm run dev` to start your development. If you are given access to Vercel proejct, then you can run `npm run vercel:dev` instead. You might notice certain features in the local dev version not working, for example Ai feature or Supabase Connection. This is because you need to specify a environment file for local development and it stays in your local and never pushed to GitHub. You should create your own environment file in order for some features to work:

`.env.local`

```
SITE_URL="http://localhost:3000"

For any missing values in the environment sample above, if you need it, please feel free to leave me a message and I will assist you in setting up.

## Why not use Vercel env and do `vercel pull`?

Yes the most convenient way is to use Vercel. However, unfortunately I'm on FREE plan in vercel so I cannot add team members in order to do so. So for now, you have to create your own local env file ðŸ˜… sorry for the inconvenience!
